Subtask 1.1: Setting Up the Lab Environment
First, let's create a project and deploy a sample application that we can use for debugging exercises.

Login to OpenShift cluster:
oc login --server=https://your-openshift-cluster:6443
Create a new project for debugging exercises:
oc new-project debug-lab
Deploy a sample application with intentional issues:
oc new-app --name=buggy-app --image=nginx:1.20 --env=NGINX_PORT=8080
Create a problematic deployment:
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: problematic-app
  namespace: debug-lab
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: problematic-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: problematic-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-server
        image: httpd:2.4
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: APACHE_LOG_LEVEL
          value: "debug"
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "2000m"
          limits:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "1000m"
EOF
Subtask 1.2: Using oc status for High-Level Troubleshooting
The oc status command provides an overview of your project's current state.

Check overall project status:
oc status
Get detailed status information:
oc status --suggest
Analyze the output and look for:
Services without endpoints
Deployments that aren't scaling
Build or deployment warnings
Suggested actions
Subtask 1.3: Using oc describe for Detailed Resource Information
The oc describe command provides detailed information about specific resources.

Describe the problematic deployment:
oc describe deployment problematic-app
Describe pods to identify issues:
oc get pods
oc describe pod <pod-name-from-previous-command>
Look for key information in the describe output:

Events section: Shows recent activities and errors
Conditions: Indicates the current state
Resource limits: Check if resources are causing issues
Describe the service:

oc describe service buggy-app
Subtask 1.4: Using oc logs for Application Debugging
The oc logs command helps you examine application output and error messages.

View current logs from a pod:
oc logs deployment/buggy-app
Follow logs in real-time:
oc logs -f deployment/buggy-app
View logs from previous container instances:
oc logs deployment/buggy-app --previous
Get logs from all containers in a pod:
