Sample application code
Task 1: Write a Dockerfile for a Sample Application
Subtask 1.1: Create the Sample Application
First, let's create a simple Node.js web application that we'll containerize.

Create a project directory:
mkdir ~/containerization-lab
cd ~/containerization-lab
Create the main application file:
cat > app.js << 'EOF'
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 8080;

// Middleware to parse JSON
app.use(express.json());

// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({
        status: 'healthy',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        version: '1.0.0'
    });
});

// Main application endpoint
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        message: 'Welcome to the Containerized Application!',
        environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development',
        hostname: require('os').hostname()
    });
});

// API endpoint for demonstration
app.get('/api/info', (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        application: 'Sample Containerized App',
        version: '1.0.0',
        author: 'OpenShift Developer',
        description: 'A simple Node.js application for containerization demonstration'
    });
});

app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    console.log(`Application running on port ${port}`);
    console.log(`Environment: ${process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'}`);
});
EOF
Create the package.json file:
cat > package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "containerized-sample-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Sample application for containerization lab",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "dev": "NODE_ENV=development node app.js",
    "prod": "NODE_ENV=production node app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "keywords": ["nodejs", "express", "containerization", "openshift"],
  "author": "OpenShift Developer",
  "license": "MIT"
}
EOF
Subtask 1.2: Write the Dockerfile
Now let's create a comprehensive Dockerfile that follows best practices.

Create the main Dockerfile:
cat > Dockerfile << 'EOF'
# Use the official Node.js runtime as the base image
# Using specific version for reproducibility
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set metadata labels for better image management
LABEL maintainer="openshift-developer@example.com"
LABEL version="1.0.0"
LABEL description="Sample containerized Node.js application"

# Create a non-root user for security
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nodejs -u 1001

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package files first for better layer caching
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Copy application source code
COPY --chown=nodejs:nodejs . .

# Create necessary directories and set permissions
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app/logs && \
    chown -R nodejs:nodejs /usr/src/app

# Switch to non-root user
USER nodejs

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Add health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1

# Set environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV PORT=8080

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
EOF
Create a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
cat > .dockerignore << 'EOF'
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.git
.gitignore
README.md
.env
.nyc_output
coverage
.DS_Store
*.log
.vscode
.idea
EOF
Subtask 1.3: Create Additional Dockerfile Variants
Let's create alternative Dockerfiles to demonstrate different approaches.

Create a multi-stage Dockerfile:
cat > Dockerfile.multistage << 'EOF'
# Multi-stage build for optimized production image
# Stage 1: Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies)
RUN npm ci

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Run any build processes (if needed)
# RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production

LABEL maintainer="openshift-developer@example.com"
LABEL version="1.0.0"
LABEL description="Multi-stage containerized Node.js application"

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nodejs -u 1001

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Copy application from builder stage
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /usr/src/app/app.js ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /usr/src/app/package.json ./

# Switch to non-root user
USER nodejs

EXPOSE 8080

HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1

ENV NODE_ENV=production

CMD ["npm", "start"]
EOF
Task 2: Build and Test Container Images Locally
Subtask 2.1: Build the Container Image

docker logs sample-app-test

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f sample-app-test
Execute commands inside the running container:
# Access the container shell
docker exec -it sample-app-test /bin/sh

# Inside the container, check the application files
ls -la /usr/src/app
ps aux
exit
Subtask 2.3: Test Container Health and Performance
Monitor container resource usage:
# Check container resource usage
docker stats sample-app-test --no-stream

# Get detailed container information
docker inspect sample-app-test | grep -A 10 "State"
Test container restart behavior:
# Stop the container
docker stop sample-app-test

# Start it again
docker start sample-app-test

# Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:8080/health
Clean up the test container:
# Stop and remove the test container
docker stop sample-app-test
docker rm sample-app-test
Task 3: Push the Image to OpenShift's Internal Registry
Subtask 3.1: Prepare OpenShift Environment
Login to your OpenShift cluster:
# Login using your credentials
oc login --server=https://your-openshift-cluster:6443

# Create a new project for this lab
oc new-project containerization-lab

# Verify you're in the correct project
oc project
Enable the internal registry route (if not already enabled):
# Check if the registry route exists
oc get route -n openshift-image-registry

# If no route exists, create one (requires cluster-admin privileges)
# oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}' --type=merge
Get the internal registry URL:
# Get the registry route
REGISTRY_URL=$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo "Registry URL: $REGISTRY_URL"

# Alternative method if route doesn't exist
# Use the internal service
REGISTRY_URL="image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000"
echo "Internal Registry URL: $REGISTRY_URL"
Subtask 3.2: Tag and Push the Image
Tag the image for the OpenShift registry:
# Get your current project name
PROJECT_NAME=$(oc project -q)

# Tag the image for the internal registry
docker tag sample-app:v1.0.0 $REGISTRY_URL/$PROJECT_NAME/sample-app:v1.0.0

# Also create a 'latest' tag
docker tag sample-app:v1.0.0 $REGISTRY_URL/$PROJECT_NAME/sample-app:latest

# Verify the tags
docker images | grep sample-app
Login to the OpenShift registry:
# Get your OpenShift token
TOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)

# Login to the registry using Docker
echo $TOKEN | docker login -u $(oc whoami) --password-stdin $REGISTRY_URL
Push the image to the registry:
# Push the versioned image
docker push $REGISTRY_URL/$PROJECT_NAME/sample-app:v1.0.0

# Push the latest tag
docker push $REGISTRY_URL/$PROJECT_NAME/sample-app:latest
Subtask 3.3: Verify the Image in OpenShift
Check the image stream in OpenShift:
# List image streams in your project
oc get imagestreams

# Get detailed information about your image stream
oc describe imagestream sample-app

# View image stream tags
oc get imagestreamtags
Create a deployment using the pushed image:
# Create a new application from the image
oc new-app --image-stream=sample-app:latest --name=sample-app-deployment

# Check the deployment status
oc get deployments

# Check the pods
oc get pods
Expose the application:
# Create a service (if not automatically created)
oc expose deployment sample-app-deployment --port=8080

# Create a route to access the application externally
oc expose service sample-app-deployment

# Get the route URL
oc get routes
Test the deployed application:
# Get the application URL
APP_URL=$(oc get route sample-app-deployment -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')

# Test the application
curl http://$APP_URL
curl http://$APP_URL/health
curl http://$APP_URL/api/info
Subtask 3.4: Advanced Image Management
Create additional image tags:
# Tag the image with additional metadata
oc tag sample-app:latest sample-app:stable
oc tag sample-app:latest sample-app:$(date +%Y%m%d)

# View all tags
oc get imagestreamtags
Set up image change triggers:
# Check current triggers
oc describe deployment sample-app-deployment | grep -A 5 "Triggers"

# The deployment should automatically update when the image changes
# Let's verify by pushing a new version
Build and push an updated version:
# Make a small change to the application
sed -i 's/version: '\''1.0.0'\''/version: '\''1.1.0'\''/g' app.js

# Rebuild the image
docker build -t sample-app:v1.1.0 .

# Tag for registry
docker tag sample-app:v1.1.0 $REGISTRY_URL/$PROJECT_NAME/sample-app:v1.1.0
docker tag sample-app:v1.1.0 $REGISTRY_URL/$PROJECT_NAME/sample-app:latest

# Push the updated image
docker push $REGISTRY_URL/$PROJECT_NAME/sample-app:v1.1.0
docker push $REGISTRY_URL/$PROJECT_NAME/sample-app:latest

# Watch the deployment update
oc get pods -w
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Docker Build Issues
Problem: Build fails with permission errors

# Solution: Check file permissions and ownership
ls -la
chmod +r package.json app.js
Problem: npm install fails in container

# Solution: Clear npm cache and use specific npm version
RUN npm cache clean --force
RUN npm ci --only=production
Registry Push Issues
Problem: Authentication failed when pushing to registry

# Solution: Re-authenticate and check token
oc whoami -t
docker logout $REGISTRY_URL
echo $(oc whoami -t) | docker login -u $(oc whoami) --password-stdin $REGISTRY_URL
Problem: Image push is slow or fails

# Solution: Check network connectivity and registry status
oc get pods -n openshift-image-registry
curl -k https://$REGISTRY_URL/v2/
Application Deployment Issues
Problem: Pod fails to start

# Solution: Check pod logs and events
oc logs deployment/sample-app-deployment
oc describe pod <pod-name>
oc get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
Problem: Application not accessible via route

# Solution: Check service and route configuration
oc get svc
oc get routes
oc describe route sample-app-deployment
