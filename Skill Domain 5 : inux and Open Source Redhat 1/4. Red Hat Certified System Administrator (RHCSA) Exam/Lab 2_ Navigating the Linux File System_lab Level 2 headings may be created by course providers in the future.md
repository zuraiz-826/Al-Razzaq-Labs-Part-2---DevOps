Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, students should have:

Basic understanding of what an operating system is
Familiarity with the concept of files and folders
Access to a terminal or command line interface
Basic knowledge of typing commands in a terminal
Note: Al Nafi provides ready-to-use Linux-based cloud machines. Simply click Start Lab to begin - no need to build your own virtual machine or install Linux locally.

Lab Environment Setup
Your Al Nafi cloud machine comes pre-configured with:

CentOS/RHEL-based Linux distribution
All necessary tools and commands pre-installed
Standard Linux file system hierarchy
Sample files and directories for practice
Task 1: Explore Different File System Paths
Understanding the Linux File System Structure
The Linux file system follows a hierarchical tree structure, starting from the root directory /. Think of it like an upside-down tree where / is the root, and all other directories branch out from there.

Subtask 1.1: Examine the Root Directory
Open your terminal in the Al Nafi cloud machine

Display your current location using the print working directory command:

pwd
Navigate to the root directory:
cd /
List the contents of the root directory:
ls -la
Examine key directories by exploring their purposes:
# View system binaries
ls /bin

# View user home directories
ls /home

# View system configuration files
ls /etc

# View variable data files
ls /var
Subtask 1.2: Navigate Using Absolute Paths
An absolute path always starts from the root directory / and provides the complete path to a file or directory.

Navigate to your home directory using absolute path:
cd /home/$(whoami)
Create a test directory structure:
mkdir -p /home/$(whoami)/lab2/documents/projects
mkdir -p /home/$(whoami)/lab2/downloads
mkdir -p /home/$(whoami)/lab2/scripts
Navigate using absolute paths:
# Go to projects directory
cd /home/$(whoami)/lab2/documents/projects

# Verify your location
pwd

# Go to downloads directory
cd /home/$(whoami)/lab2/downloads

# Verify your location
pwd
Subtask 1.3: Navigate Using Relative Paths
A relative path is relative to your current location and doesn't start with /.

Start from your home directory:
cd ~
Navigate using relative paths:
# Go to lab2 directory (relative to home)
cd lab2

# Go to documents from lab2 (relative path)
cd documents

# Go up one level to lab2
cd ..

# Go to scripts directory (relative to lab2)
cd scripts

# Go up two levels to home directory
cd ../..
Practice with special relative path symbols:
# Current directory
ls .

# Parent directory
ls ..

# Go to parent directory
cd ..

# Go to previous directory
cd -
Subtask 1.4: Create Sample Files for Testing
Create sample files in different locations:
# Create files in different directories
touch ~/lab2/documents/report.txt
touch ~/lab2/documents/projects/project1.txt
touch ~/lab2/downloads/software.tar.gz
touch ~/lab2/scripts/backup.sh

# Create a file with executable permissions
echo '#!/bin/bash' > ~/lab2/scripts/hello.sh
echo 'echo "Hello, World!"' >> ~/lab2/scripts/hello.sh
chmod +x ~/lab2/scripts/hello.sh
Verify file creation:
# List files recursively
find ~/lab2 -type f
Task 2: Use find, locate, and which to Locate Files
Subtask 2.1: Using the find Command
The find command searches for files and directories in real-time based on various criteria.

Basic find syntax and examples:
# Find all files in lab2 directory
find ~/lab2 -type f

# Find all directories in lab2
find ~/lab2 -type d

# Find files by name
find ~/lab2 -name "*.txt"

# Find files by name (case-insensitive)
find ~/lab2 -iname "*.TXT"
Advanced find operations:
# Find files modified in the last 10 minutes
find ~/lab2 -mtime -10

# Find executable files
find ~/lab2 -type f -executable

# Find files larger than 0 bytes
find ~/lab2 -type f -size +0c

# Find and execute commands on results
find ~/lab2 -name "*.sh" -exec ls -la {} \;
Find system files:
# Find configuration files
find /etc -name "*.conf" 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Find log files
find /var/log -name "*.log" 2>/dev/null | head -5
Subtask 2.2: Using the locate Command
The locate command uses a pre-built database to quickly find files. It's faster than find but requires the database to be updated.

Update the locate database (may require sudo privileges):
# Update the database (run as root or with sudo)
sudo updatedb
Use locate to find files:
# Locate files by name
locate report.txt

# Locate files with pattern
locate "*.conf" | head -10

# Locate case-insensitive
locate -i REPORT.TXT

# Count matches
locate -c "*.log"
Compare locate vs find performance:
# Time the locate command
time locate passwd

# Time the find command
time find / -name "passwd" 2>/dev/null
Subtask 2.3: Using the which Command
The which command locates executable programs in the system PATH.

Find executable programs:
# Find location of common commands
which ls
which find
which bash
which python3

# Find multiple commands at once
which ls find grep awk
Understand PATH variable:
# Display current PATH
echo $PATH

# Show all locations of a command
which -a python
Test with custom executable:
# Add lab2/scripts to PATH temporarily
export PATH=$PATH:~/lab2/scripts

# Now which can find our custom script
which hello.sh

# Execute the script
hello.sh
Task 3: Practice Using Relative and Absolute Paths
Subtask 3.1: Path Navigation Exercises
Create a complex directory structure:
mkdir -p ~/lab2/company/{hr,finance,it}/{reports,archives}
mkdir -p ~/lab2/company/it/{servers,workstations}
Practice navigation scenarios:
# Start from home directory
cd ~

# Navigate to IT department using absolute path
cd ~/lab2/company/it

# Navigate to servers using relative path
cd servers

# Go back to IT department
cd ..

# Navigate to HR reports using relative path
cd ../hr/reports

# Navigate to finance archives using absolute path
cd ~/lab2/company/finance/archives

# Navigate to workstations using relative path
cd ../../it/workstations
Subtask 3.2: File Operations with Different Path Types
Copy files using different path types:
# Create source files
echo "HR Report 2024" > ~/lab2/company/hr/reports/annual.txt
echo "Server Config" > ~/lab2/company/it/servers/config.txt

# Copy using absolute paths
cp ~/lab2/company/hr/reports/annual.txt ~/lab2/company/finance/reports/

# Navigate and copy using relative paths
cd ~/lab2/company/it/servers
cp config.txt ../workstations/
Move files using relative paths:
# Navigate to a directory
cd ~/lab2/company/hr

# Move file using relative path
mv reports/annual.txt archives/

# Verify the move
ls archives/
ls reports/
Subtask 3.3: Advanced Path Manipulation
Use path shortcuts effectively:
# Navigate to a deep directory
cd ~/lab2/company/finance/archives

# Use .. to go up multiple levels
cd ../../../it/servers

# Use absolute path to jump anywhere
cd ~/lab2/documents/projects

# Use cd - to toggle between directories
cd ~/lab2/company/hr/reports
cd -  # Goes back to projects
cd -  # Goes back to hr/reports
Combine find with path operations:
# Find all .txt files and show their absolute paths
find ~/lab2 -name "*.txt" -exec readlink -f {} \;

# Find files and copy them to a central location
mkdir ~/lab2/all_txt_files
find ~/lab2 -name "*.txt" -exec cp {} ~/lab2/all_txt_files/ \;
Practical Scenarios and Real-World Applications
Scenario 1: System Administration Task
# Find all configuration files in /etc
find /etc -name "*.conf" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Locate system logs
find /var/log -name "*.log" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Find recently modified files
find /var/log -mtime -1 -type f 2>/dev/null
Scenario 2: Development Environment Setup
# Create a typical development directory structure
mkdir -p ~/development/{projects,tools,documentation}
mkdir -p ~/development/projects/{web,mobile,desktop}

# Navigate efficiently between project directories
cd ~/development/projects/web
# ... do some work
cd ../mobile
# ... do some work
cd ../../tools
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: Permission Denied Errors
# If you get permission denied, try:
find /etc -name "*.conf" 2>/dev/null

# The 2>/dev/null redirects error messages
Issue 2: locate Command Not Finding Recent Files
# Update the locate database
sudo updatedb

# Or use find for real-time search
find ~ -name "filename"
Issue 3: Path Not Found
# Verify your current location
pwd

# Check if directory exists
ls -la /path/to/directory

# Use tab completion to avoid typos
cd ~/lab2/[TAB][TAB]
Verification and Testing
Test Your Knowledge
Navigation Test:
# Start from home directory
cd ~

# Navigate to ~/lab2/company/it/servers using only relative paths
# (Write down your commands)

# Navigate to ~/lab2/documents using absolute path
# Verify with pwd
File Location Test:
# Find all .sh files in your lab2 directory
find ~/lab2 -name "*.sh"

# Locate the bash executable
which bash

# Find all files modified in the last hour
find ~/lab2 -mtime -1
Conclusion
In this lab, you have successfully:

Mastered Linux file system navigation by understanding the hierarchical structure starting from the root directory /
Learned the difference between absolute and relative paths and when to use each approach effectively
Practiced using essential file location commands including find for real-time searching, locate for database-driven searches, and which for finding executables
Applied navigation skills in practical scenarios that mirror real-world system administration and development tasks
Why This Matters
Understanding Linux file system navigation is fundamental for:

System Administration: Efficiently managing servers, configuration files, and logs
Software Development: Organizing projects and navigating codebases
RHCSA Certification: These skills are essential for the Red Hat Certified System Administrator exam
Daily Linux Usage: Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or power user
Key Takeaways
Absolute paths (/home/user/file) provide complete location information and work from anywhere
Relative paths (../documents/file) are shorter and work relative to your current location
find is powerful for real-time searches with complex criteria
locate is fast but requires an updated database
which helps you find executable programs in your PATH
These navigation skills form the foundation for more advanced Linux operations you'll encounter in future labs and real-world scenarios. Practice these commands regularly to build muscle memory and increase your efficiency in Linux environments.
