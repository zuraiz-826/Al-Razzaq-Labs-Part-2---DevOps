Task 1: Change File Ownership Using chown
Understanding File Ownership
In Linux, every file and directory has an owner (user) and a group. The chown command allows you to change both the user owner and group owner of files and directories.

Subtask 1.1: Examine Current File Ownership
First, let's create some test files and examine their current ownership.

Create a working directory and test files:
# Create a lab directory
mkdir ~/permissions_lab
cd ~/permissions_lab

# Create test files
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
mkdir testdir

# Create some content in the files
echo "This is file 1" > file1.txt
echo "This is file 2" > file2.txt
echo "This is file 3" > file3.txt
Examine current ownership:
# View detailed file information including ownership
ls -l

# View ownership in a more readable format
ls -l | awk '{print $3, $4, $9}' | column -t
Expected Output:

-rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 14 Nov 15 10:30 file1.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 14 Nov 15 10:30 file2.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 14 Nov 15 10:30 file3.txt
drwxrwxr-x 2 student student 40 Nov 15 10:30 testdir
Subtask 1.2: Change User Ownership
Change ownership of a single file:
# Change owner of file1.txt to root (requires sudo)
sudo chown root file1.txt

# Verify the change
ls -l file1.txt
Change ownership back to current user:
# Change owner back to current user
sudo chown $USER file1.txt

# Verify the change
ls -l file1.txt
Subtask 1.3: Change Group Ownership
View available groups:
# List groups the current user belongs to
groups

# View all groups on the system
cat /etc/group | head -10
Change group ownership:
# Change group ownership to 'users' group
sudo chown :users file2.txt

# Verify the change
ls -l file2.txt
Subtask 1.4: Change Both User and Group Ownership
Change both user and group simultaneously:
# Change both user and group ownership
sudo chown root:root file3.txt

# Verify the change
ls -l file3.txt

# Change back to original user and group
sudo chown $USER:$USER file3.txt
ls -l file3.txt
Subtask 1.5: Recursive Ownership Changes
Create nested directory structure:
# Create nested directories with files
mkdir -p testdir/subdir1/subdir2
touch testdir/nested_file.txt
touch testdir/subdir1/another_file.txt
touch testdir/subdir1/subdir2/deep_file.txt
Apply recursive ownership changes:
# Change ownership recursively
sudo chown -R root:root testdir/

# Verify recursive changes
ls -lR testdir/

# Change back recursively
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER testdir/
ls -lR testdir/
Task 2: Modify File Permissions Using chmod
Understanding Linux Permissions
Linux permissions are represented in three categories:

User (u): The file owner
Group (g): The group that owns the file
Other (o): Everyone else
Each category has three permission types:

Read (r): Permission to read the file (4 in numeric)
Write (w): Permission to modify the file (2 in numeric)
Execute (x): Permission to execute the file (1 in numeric)
Subtask 2.1: Understanding Current Permissions
Examine current permissions in detail:
# View current permissions
ls -l

# Create a script file for testing
echo '#!/bin/bash' > test_script.sh
echo 'echo "Hello from script!"' >> test_script.sh

# Check script permissions
ls -l test_script.sh
Try to execute the script:
# This should fail because execute permission is not set
./test_script.sh
Subtask 2.2: Using Symbolic Notation with chmod
Add execute permission for user:
# Add execute permission for the user (owner)
chmod u+x test_script.sh

# Verify the change
ls -l test_script.sh

# Now try to execute the script
./test_script.sh
Modify permissions using symbolic notation:
# Remove write permission for group and others
chmod go-w file1.txt

# Add read permission for all
chmod a+r file2.txt

# Remove all permissions for others
chmod o-rwx file3.txt

# Verify all changes
ls -l file*.txt
Set specific permission combinations:
# Set read and write for user, read for group, no permissions for others
chmod u=rw,g=r,o= file1.txt

# Set full permissions for user, read and execute for group and others
chmod u=rwx,go=rx testdir/

# Verify changes
ls -l file1.txt
ls -ld testdir/
Subtask 2.3: Using Numeric Notation with chmod
Understanding numeric permissions:
# Create a reference file
touch numeric_test.txt

# Set permissions using numeric notation
# 755 = rwxr-xr-x (user: rwx=7, group: r-x=5, others: r-x=5)
chmod 755 numeric_test.txt

# 644 = rw-r--r-- (user: rw-=6, group: r--=4, others: r--=4)
chmod 644 file1.txt

# 600 = rw------- (user: rw-=6, group: ---=0, others: ---=0)
chmod 600 file2.txt

# 777 = rwxrwxrwx (full permissions for all)
chmod 777 file3.txt

# Verify all changes
ls -l *test*.txt file*.txt
Common permission patterns:
# Create files to demonstrate common patterns
touch readme.txt config.conf executable.sh

# Standard file permissions (644)
chmod 644 readme.txt

# Configuration file permissions (600)
chmod 600 config.conf

# Executable script permissions (755)
chmod 755 executable.sh

# Verify the patterns
ls -l readme.txt config.conf executable.sh
Subtask 2.4: Recursive Permission Changes
Apply permissions recursively:
# Set directory permissions recursively
chmod -R 755 testdir/

# Verify recursive changes
ls -lR testdir/

# Set more restrictive permissions
chmod -R 644 testdir/

# Note: This makes directories non-executable, which prevents access
# Let's fix directory permissions while keeping file permissions
find testdir/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find testdir/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

# Verify the fix
ls -lR testdir/
Task 3: Apply Access Control Lists (ACLs) for Fine-Grained Control
Understanding ACLs
Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide more granular permission control than traditional Unix permissions. They allow you to set permissions for specific users and groups beyond the basic owner/group/other model.

Subtask 3.1: Check ACL Support and Install Tools
Verify ACL support:
# Check if ACLs are supported on the current filesystem
mount | grep acl

# Check if ACL tools are installed
which getfacl setfacl

# If not installed, install ACL utilities (on RHEL/CentOS)
sudo yum install -y acl
Create test files for ACL demonstration:
# Create files for ACL testing
mkdir acl_test
cd acl_test
touch sensitive_file.txt shared_document.txt
echo "Sensitive information" > sensitive_file.txt
echo "Shared document content" > shared_document.txt
Subtask 3.2: View Current ACLs
Check existing ACLs:
# View ACLs for files (initially should show standard permissions)
getfacl sensitive_file.txt
getfacl shared_document.txt

# View ACLs in a more compact format
getfacl --omit-header sensitive_file.txt
Expected Output:

# file: sensitive_file.txt
# owner: student
# group: student
user::rw-
group::rw-
other::r--
Subtask 3.3: Set User-Specific ACLs
Grant specific user permissions:
# Create a test user (if not exists)
sudo useradd testuser1 2>/dev/null || echo "User testuser1 already exists"

# Grant read and write access to testuser1
setfacl -m u:testuser1:rw sensitive_file.txt

# Verify the ACL
getfacl sensitive_file.txt

# Check how ls shows ACL-enabled files (notice the + sign)
ls -l sensitive_file.txt
Grant different permissions to another user:
# Create another test user
sudo useradd testuser2 2>/dev/null || echo "User testuser2 already exists"

# Grant only read access to testuser2
setfacl -m u:testuser2:r sensitive_file.txt

# Verify the updated ACL
getfacl sensitive_file.txt
Subtask 3.4: Set Group-Specific ACLs
Create test groups and set group ACLs:
# Create test groups
sudo groupadd developers 2>/dev/null || echo "Group developers already exists"
sudo groupadd managers 2>/dev/null || echo "Group managers already exists"

# Grant full access to developers group
setfacl -m g:developers:rwx shared_document.txt

# Grant read-only access to managers group
setfacl -m g:managers:r shared_document.txt

# Verify group ACLs
getfacl shared_document.txt
Subtask 3.5: Set Default ACLs for Directories
Create a directory and set default ACLs:
# Create a project directory
mkdir project_dir

# Set default ACLs for new files created in this directory
setfacl -d -m u:testuser1:rw project_dir/
setfacl -d -m g:developers:rwx project_dir/
setfacl -d -m other::r project_dir/

# View default ACLs
getfacl project_dir/
Test default ACL inheritance:
# Create a new file in the directory
touch project_dir/new_file.txt

# Check if the new file inherited the default ACLs
getfacl project_dir/new_file.txt

# Create a subdirectory
mkdir project_dir/subdir

# Check ACL inheritance for directories
getfacl project_dir/subdir/
Subtask 3.6: Modify and Remove ACLs
Modify existing ACLs:
# Change testuser1's permissions from rw to rwx
setfacl -m u:testuser1:rwx sensitive_file.txt

# Verify the change
getfacl sensitive_file.txt
Remove specific ACL entries:
# Remove testuser2's ACL entry
setfacl -x u:testuser2 sensitive_file.txt

# Remove developers group ACL
setfacl -x g:developers shared_document.txt

# Verify removals
getfacl sensitive_file.txt
getfacl shared_document.txt
Remove all ACLs:
# Remove all ACLs from a file (revert to standard permissions)
setfacl -b sensitive_file.txt

# Verify ACL removal
getfacl sensitive_file.txt
ls -l sensitive_file.txt
Subtask 3.7: Advanced ACL Operations
Copy ACLs between files:
# Set up source file with complex ACLs
setfacl -m u:testuser1:rwx shared_document.txt
setfacl -m g:developers:rw shared_document.txt
setfacl -m g:managers:r shared_document.txt

# Create target file
touch target_file.txt

# Copy ACLs from source to target
getfacl shared_document.txt | setfacl --set-file=- target_file.txt

# Verify ACL copy
getfacl target_file.txt
Backup and restore ACLs:
# Backup ACLs for all files in current directory
getfacl -R . > acl_backup.txt

# View the backup file
cat acl_backup.txt

# To restore ACLs (demonstration - don't run unless needed)
# setfacl --restore=acl_backup.txt
Practical Scenarios and Best Practices
Scenario 1: Web Server File Permissions
# Create a web directory structure
mkdir -p /tmp/webserver/{html,logs,config}

# Set appropriate permissions for web content
sudo chmod 755 /tmp/webserver/html
sudo chmod 644 /tmp/webserver/html/*

# Set restrictive permissions for configuration
sudo chmod 600 /tmp/webserver/config/*

# Set log directory permissions
sudo chmod 755 /tmp/webserver/logs
sudo chmod 644 /tmp/webserver/logs/*
Scenario 2: Shared Project Directory
# Create shared project setup
mkdir /tmp/shared_project
sudo chown :developers /tmp/shared_project
sudo chmod 2775 /tmp/shared_project  # Set SGID bit

# Set default ACLs for collaboration
sudo setfacl -d -m g:developers:rwx /tmp/shared_project/
sudo setfacl -d -m other::r /tmp/shared_project/
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: Permission Denied Errors
# Check current user and groups
whoami
groups

# Check file permissions and ownership
ls -l filename
getfacl filename

# Check parent directory permissions
ls -ld /path/to/parent/directory
Issue 2: ACL Not Working
# Verify filesystem supports ACLs
mount | grep acl

# Check if ACL packages are installed
rpm -qa | grep acl

# Remount filesystem with ACL support if needed
sudo mount -o remount,acl /
Issue 3: Recursive Permission Problems
# Fix mixed file and directory permissions
find /path -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
find /path -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
Lab Cleanup
# Return to home directory
cd ~

# Clean up test files and directories
rm -rf permissions_lab acl_test

# Remove test users and groups (optional)
sudo userdel testuser1 2>/dev/null
sudo userdel testuser2 2>/dev/null
sudo groupdel developers 2>/dev/null
sudo groupdel managers 2>/dev/null

# Clean up temporary directories
sudo rm -rf /tmp/webserver /tmp/shared_project
Conclusion
In this lab, you have successfully learned how to manage Linux file permissions and ownership through three key areas:

File Ownership Management: You mastered the chown command to change both user and group ownership of files and directories, including recursive operations for complex directory structures.

Permission Control: You learned to use chmod with both symbolic and numeric notation to set appropriate access levels for users, groups, and others, understanding common permission patterns used in real-world scenarios.

Advanced Access Control: You implemented Access Control Lists (ACLs) using setfacl and getfacl to provide fine-grained permission control beyond traditional Unix permissions, including default ACLs for directories.

These skills are fundamental for Linux system administration and are essential for the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) exam. Proper permission management ensures system security, enables collaboration, and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data. You can now confidently secure files and directories in production environments, troubleshoot permission-related issues, and implement complex access control scenarios using both traditional permissions and modern ACL systems.

The hands-on experience gained in this lab provides you with practical skills that directly apply to real-world Linux administration tasks, from securing web server files to managing shared development environments.
