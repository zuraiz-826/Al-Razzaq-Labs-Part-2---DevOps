# Search for specific text in a file
grep "sshd" system.log

# Search for text ignoring case
grep -i "failed" system.log

# Count occurrences of a pattern
grep -c "httpd" system.log

# Show line numbers with matches
grep -n "admin" system.log
Subtask 1.3: Advanced grep Options
Practice more advanced grep features:

# Search for lines that do NOT contain a pattern
grep -v "httpd" system.log

# Search recursively in directories (create subdirectory first)
mkdir logs
cp system.log logs/
grep -r "Failed" .

# Search for whole words only
grep -w "admin" users.txt

# Search for multiple patterns
grep -E "sshd|httpd" system.log

# Search for patterns at the beginning of lines
grep "^Jan 15 10:3[0-5]" system.log
Subtask 1.4: Using Regular Expressions with grep
Learn to use regular expressions for complex pattern matching:

# Search for IP addresses
grep -E "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}" system.log

# Search for lines ending with specific text
grep "bash$" users.txt

# Search for any digit
grep "[0-9]" config.conf

# Search for lines with specific character ranges
grep "[A-Z]" config.conf
Task 2: Using sed for Search and Replace
Subtask 2.1: Basic sed Operations
Learn fundamental sed commands for text manipulation:

# Display specific lines
sed -n '1,3p' users.txt

# Delete specific lines (display only, doesn't modify file)
sed '2d' users.txt

# Replace first occurrence in each line
sed 's/admin/administrator/' users.txt

# Replace all occurrences in each line
sed 's/:/|/g' users.txt
Subtask 2.2: In-Place File Editing
Practice modifying files directly with sed:

# Create a backup copy first
cp config.conf config.conf.backup

# Replace text and save changes to file
sed -i 's/Port 80/Port 8080/' config.conf

# Verify the change
grep "Port" config.conf

# Replace multiple patterns
sed -i -e 's/localhost/127.0.0.1/' -e 's/secret123/newpassword/' config.conf

# Verify changes
cat config.conf
Subtask 2.3: Advanced sed Operations
Explore more complex sed functionality:

# Delete lines containing specific pattern
sed -i '/^#/d' config.conf

# Insert text after specific line
sed -i '/ServerName/a ServerAlias www.example.com' config.conf

# Insert text before specific line
sed -i '/DocumentRoot/i # Document root configuration' config.conf

# Replace text only on specific lines
sed -i '5s/150/200/' config.conf

# View the modified file
cat config.conf
Subtask 2.4: sed with Regular Expressions
Combine sed with regular expressions for powerful text processing:

# Create a new sample file for this exercise
cat > addresses.txt << 'EOF'
John Smith, 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001
Mary Johnson, 456 Oak Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90210

EOF

# Replace state abbreviations with full names
sed -i 's/NY/New York/g; s/CA/California/g; s/IL/Illinois/g; s/TX/Texas/g' addresses.txt

# Remove all digits from addresses
sed 's/[0-9]//g' addresses.txt

# Extract only names (everything before first comma)
sed 's/,.*$//' addresses.txt
Task 3: Creating Basic awk Scripts
Subtask 3.1: Basic awk Operations
Learn fundamental awk concepts and commands:

# Print specific columns
awk -F: '{print $1, $5}' users.txt

# Print with custom formatting
awk -F: '{print "User: " $1 ", Home: " $6}' users.txt

# Print lines with specific conditions
awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 {print $1}' users.txt

# Count and print number of fields
awk -F: '{print NF, $0}' users.txt
Subtask 3.2: awk Pattern Matching and Conditions
Practice using patterns and conditions in awk:

# Print lines matching a pattern
awk '/bash/ {print $1}' users.txt

# Print lines with field matching condition
awk -F: '$7 == "/bin/bash" {print $1, $5}' users.txt

# Use BEGIN and END blocks
awk -F: 'BEGIN {print "=== User Report ==="} {print $1, $5} END {print "=== End Report ==="}' users.txt

# Count occurrences
awk -F: '$7 == "/bin/bash" {count++} END {print "Bash users:", count}' users.txt
Subtask 3.3: awk Built-in Variables and Functions
Explore awk's built-in variables and functions:

# Use NR (Number of Records) and NF (Number of Fields)
awk -F: '{print "Line " NR ": " $1 " has " NF " fields"}' users.txt

# Use length function
awk -F: '{print $1, length($1)}' users.txt

# Use substr function
awk -F: '{print substr($5, 1, 10)}' users.txt

# Process log files with awk
awk '{print $3, $4, $6}' system.log
Subtask 3.4: Creating awk Scripts
Create more complex awk scripts for real-world scenarios:

# Create a script to analyze log files
cat > loganalysis.awk << 'EOF'
BEGIN {
    print "=== Log Analysis Report ==="
    ssh_success = 0
    ssh_failed = 0
    http_requests = 0
}

/sshd.*Accepted/ {
    ssh_success++
}

/sshd.*Failed/ {

}

END {
    print "SSH Successful logins:", ssh_success
    print "SSH Failed logins:", ssh_failed
    print "HTTP Requests:", http_requests
    print "=== End Report ==="
}
EOF

# Run the awk script
awk -f loganalysis.awk system.log

cat > usersummary.awk << 'EOF'
BEGIN {
    FS = ":"
    print "=== User Summary ==="
    bash_users = 0
    system_users = 0
}

$3 < 1000 {
    system_users++
}

$3 >= 1000 && $7 == "/bin/bash" {

echo
echo "404 Not Found errors:"
grep " 404 " access.log | awk '{print $1, $7}'
Troubleshooting Tips
Common Issues and Solutions
Issue 1: grep returns no results when you expect matches

Solution: Check for case sensitivity, use -i flag for case-insensitive search
Example: grep -i "error" logfile.txt
Issue 2: sed changes not persisting

Solution: Use -i flag for in-place editing or redirect output to new file
Example: sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt
Issue 3: awk field separator not working correctly

Solution: Explicitly set field separator with -F option
Example: awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
Issue 4: Regular expressions not matching expected patterns

Solution: Escape special characters and test patterns incrementally
Example: grep "192\.168\.1\.[0-9]" logfile.txt
Best Practices
• Always test commands on sample data before applying to production files • Create backups before using sed -i for in-place editing • Use quotes around patterns to prevent shell interpretation • Combine tools gradually, testing each step in the pipeline • Use head or tail commands to limit output when testing on large files

Conclusion
In this lab, you have successfully learned to use three powerful text processing tools that are essential for system administration and the RHCSA exam:

grep - You mastered searching for patterns in files using regular expressions, case-insensitive searches, and various output formatting options. These skills are crucial for log analysis and system troubleshooting.

sed - You learned to perform search and replace operations, both for display and in-place file editing. This tool is invaluable for configuration file management and automated text processing.

awk - You created scripts for pattern scanning and data processing, learning to work with fields, conditions, and built-in functions. This knowledge enables you to generate reports and analyze structured data efficiently.

Combined Usage - Most importantly, you learned to chain these tools together using pipes, creating powerful text processing workflows that can handle complex system administration tasks.

These text processing skills are fundamental for Linux system administrators and are frequently tested in the RHCSA exam. They enable you to efficiently analyze log files, process configuration files, generate reports, and automate routine text manipulation tasks. The ability to combine these tools makes you more effective in managing Linux systems and troubleshooting issues in production environments.

Continue practicing these tools with your own data files and real system logs to build proficiency and confidence in text processing operations.
