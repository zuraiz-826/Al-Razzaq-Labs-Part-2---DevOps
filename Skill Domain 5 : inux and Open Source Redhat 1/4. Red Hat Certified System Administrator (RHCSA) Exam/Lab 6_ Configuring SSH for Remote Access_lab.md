Lab Environment Setup
Ready-to-Use Cloud Machines: Al Nafi provides pre-configured Linux-based cloud machines for this lab. Simply click Start Lab to access your environment - no need to build your own virtual machine or configure additional infrastructure.

Your lab environment includes:

Two CentOS/RHEL 8 or 9 virtual machines
Root and regular user access
Network connectivity between machines
All necessary repositories configured
Task 1: Install OpenSSH Server and Client
Subtask 1.1: Check Current SSH Installation Status
First, let's verify what SSH components are already installed on your system.

# Check if SSH client is installed
which ssh

# Check if SSH server is installed
which sshd

# Check SSH service status
systemctl status sshd
Subtask 1.2: Install OpenSSH Components
Install both SSH server and client packages:

# Update package repositories
sudo dnf update -y

# Install OpenSSH server and client
sudo dnf install -y openssh-server openssh-clients

# Verify installation
rpm -qa | grep openssh
Expected output should show packages like:

openssh-server
openssh-clients
openssh
Subtask 1.3: Start and Enable SSH Service
Configure the SSH service to start automatically:

# Start SSH service immediately
sudo systemctl start sshd

# Enable SSH service to start at boot
sudo systemctl enable sshd

# Verify service is running
sudo systemctl status sshd

# Check if SSH is listening on port 22
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :22
Subtask 1.4: Configure Firewall for SSH
Ensure the firewall allows SSH connections:

# Check current firewall status
sudo firewall-cmd --state

# Add SSH service to firewall (permanent)
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh

# Reload firewall configuration
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Verify SSH is allowed
sudo firewall-cmd --list-services
Task 2: Test SSH Access Locally and Remotely
Subtask 2.1: Create Test User Account
Create a dedicated user for SSH testing:

# Create new user
sudo useradd -m sshuser

# Set password for the user
sudo passwd sshuser

# Add user to wheel group for sudo access (optional)
sudo usermod -aG wheel sshuser

# Verify user creation
id sshuser
Subtask 2.2: Test Local SSH Connection
Test SSH connectivity to the local machine:

# Get your machine's IP address
ip addr show

# Test SSH to localhost using username
ssh sshuser@localhost

# Alternative test using IP address
ssh sshuser@127.0.0.1

# Exit the SSH session
exit
Subtask 2.3: Test Remote SSH Connection
If you have access to a second machine, test remote connectivity:

# From Machine A, connect to Machine B
# Replace IP_ADDRESS with actual IP of target machine
ssh sshuser@IP_ADDRESS

# Example connection with verbose output for troubleshooting
ssh -v sshuser@IP_ADDRESS

# Test connection with specific port (if changed from default)
ssh -p 22 sshuser@IP_ADDRESS
Subtask 2.4: Verify SSH Configuration File
Examine the main SSH server configuration:

# View SSH server configuration
sudo cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Check for key configuration parameters
sudo grep -E "^(Port|PermitRootLogin|PasswordAuthentication|PubkeyAuthentication)" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Key parameters to note:

Port 22: Default SSH port
PermitRootLogin: Controls root user SSH access
PasswordAuthentication: Enables/disables password-based login
PubkeyAuthentication: Enables/disables key-based authentication
Task 3: Set Up Key-Based Authentication for SSH
Subtask 3.1: Generate SSH Key Pair
Create SSH keys for secure authentication:

# Switch to the test user
su - sshuser

# Generate SSH key pair (RSA 4096-bit)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "sshuser@lab-machine"

# Alternative: Generate ED25519 key (more secure, modern)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "sshuser@lab-machine"

# View generated keys
ls -la ~/.ssh/
When prompted:

File location: Press Enter for default location
Passphrase: Enter a secure passphrase or leave empty for testing
Subtask 3.2: Copy Public Key to Target Machine
For local testing, copy the key to the same machine:

# Copy public key to authorized_keys (local machine)
ssh-copy-id sshuser@localhost

# Alternative manual method
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Set proper permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
For remote machines:

# Copy public key to remote machine
ssh-copy-id sshuser@REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS

# Verify the key was copied
ssh sshuser@REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS "cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
Subtask 3.3: Test Key-Based Authentication
Test the key-based login:

# Test key-based authentication locally
ssh sshuser@localhost

# Test with verbose output to see authentication method
ssh -v sshuser@localhost

# Test remote key-based authentication
ssh sshuser@REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS
You should now be able to log in without entering a password (unless you set a key passphrase).

Subtask 3.4: Disable Password Authentication (Security Enhancement)
For enhanced security, disable password-based authentication:

# Exit from user session back to root/sudo user
exit

# Backup original SSH configuration
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup

# Edit SSH configuration
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Make the following changes in the configuration file:

# Find and modify these lines:
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
PermitRootLogin no
Apply the configuration changes:

# Test configuration syntax
sudo sshd -t

# Restart SSH service to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart sshd

# Verify service is still running
sudo systemctl status sshd
Subtask 3.5: Test Security Configuration
Verify that password authentication is disabled:

# Try to connect with password (should fail)
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password sshuser@localhost

# Successful key-based connection
ssh sshuser@localhost
Advanced Configuration and Security
Configure SSH Client Settings
Create a client configuration file for easier connections:

# Create SSH client config directory
mkdir -p ~/.ssh

# Create client configuration file
nano ~/.ssh/config
Add the following configuration:

# SSH Client Configuration
Host lab-server
    HostName localhost
    User sshuser
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host remote-server
    HostName REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS
    User sshuser
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Set proper permissions:

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
Test the configuration:

# Connect using host alias
ssh lab-server
SSH Security Best Practices
Implement additional security measures:

# Edit SSH server configuration
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Add these security enhancements:

# Change default port (optional)
Port 2222

# Limit user access
AllowUsers sshuser

# Disable empty passwords
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Set login attempt limits
MaxAuthTries 3

# Set connection limits
MaxStartups 3

# Disable X11 forwarding if not needed
X11Forwarding no

# Set idle timeout
ClientAliveInterval 300
ClientAliveCountMax 2
Apply changes:

# Test configuration
sudo sshd -t

# Update firewall for new port (if changed)
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=ssh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2222/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Restart SSH service
sudo systemctl restart sshd
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: Connection Refused
# Check if SSH service is running
sudo systemctl status sshd

# Check if port is listening
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :22

# Check firewall settings
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
Issue 2: Permission Denied
# Check SSH key permissions
ls -la ~/.ssh/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Issue 3: Key Authentication Not Working
# Check SSH server logs
sudo journalctl -u sshd -f

# Verify public key in authorized_keys
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Test with verbose output
ssh -vvv sshuser@localhost
