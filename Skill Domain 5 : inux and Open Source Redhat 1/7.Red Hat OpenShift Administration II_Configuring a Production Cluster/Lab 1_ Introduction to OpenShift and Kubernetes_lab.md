Lab 1: Introduction to OpenShift and Kubernetes
Objectives
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

• Understand the fundamental concepts of OpenShift and Kubernetes • Set up and access an OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster environment • Navigate and use essential kubectl and oc command-line tools • Create, manage, and explore namespaces in a cluster • Deploy, inspect, and manage pods within the cluster • Differentiate between OpenShift and vanilla Kubernetes features • Apply basic troubleshooting techniques for common cluster issues

Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, students should have:

• Basic understanding of Linux command-line operations • Familiarity with containerization concepts (Docker basics) • Knowledge of YAML file structure and syntax • Understanding of basic networking concepts • Access to a terminal or command-line interface

Lab Environment Setup
Ready-to-Use Cloud Machines: Al Nafi provides pre-configured Linux-based cloud machines with all necessary tools installed. Simply click Start Lab to access your environment - no need to build your own VM or install additional software.

Your cloud machine includes: • Pre-installed kubectl and oc command-line tools • Access to an OpenShift cluster • All necessary configuration files • Text editors (nano, vim)

Task 1: Set up an OpenShift/Kubernetes Cluster
Subtask 1.1: Verify Cluster Access and Tools
First, let's verify that our tools are properly installed and we can access the cluster.

Check kubectl installation:
kubectl version --client
Check oc (OpenShift CLI) installation:
oc version
Verify cluster connectivity:
kubectl cluster-info
Expected output should show cluster endpoints and confirm connectivity.

Subtask 1.2: Authenticate with the OpenShift Cluster
Login to OpenShift cluster (credentials will be provided in your lab environment):
oc login --server=https://your-cluster-url:6443 --username=developer --password=developer
Verify authentication:
oc whoami
Check current context:
kubectl config current-context
Subtask 1.3: Explore Cluster Information
Get cluster nodes information:
kubectl get nodes
Get detailed node information:
kubectl get nodes -o wide
Check cluster status:
kubectl get componentstatuses
Task 2: Introduce kubectl and oc Commands
Subtask 2.1: Understanding kubectl Basics
kubectl is the primary command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

Get help for kubectl:
kubectl --help
List all available resources:
kubectl api-resources
Get cluster information:
kubectl cluster-info dump > cluster-info.txt
head -20 cluster-info.txt
Subtask 2.2: Understanding oc Commands
oc is OpenShift's enhanced CLI that includes all kubectl functionality plus OpenShift-specific features.

Get help for oc:
oc --help
List OpenShift-specific resources:
oc api-resources | grep -E "(route|build|image)"
Check OpenShift project (equivalent to namespace):
oc projects
Subtask 2.3: Common Command Patterns
Basic command structure:
# kubectl/oc [command] [resource-type] [resource-name] [flags]
kubectl get pods
oc get pods
Using different output formats:
kubectl get nodes -o json
kubectl get nodes -o yaml
kubectl get nodes -o wide
Getting detailed information:
kubectl describe node [node-name]
Task 3: Explore Namespaces and Pods in the Cluster
Subtask 3.1: Working with Namespaces
Namespaces provide a way to organize and isolate resources within a cluster.

List all namespaces:
kubectl get namespaces
Get detailed namespace information:
kubectl get namespaces -o wide
Create a new namespace:
kubectl create namespace lab-demo
Verify namespace creation:
kubectl get namespace lab-demo
Set default namespace context:
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=lab-demo
Subtask 3.2: Creating and Managing Pods
Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.

Create a simple pod using kubectl run:
kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx:latest --port=80
Verify pod creation:
kubectl get pods
Get detailed pod information:
kubectl describe pod nginx-pod
Create a pod using YAML manifest:
First, create a YAML file:

cat > apache-pod.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: apache-pod
  namespace: lab-demo
  labels:
    app: apache
    environment: lab
spec:
  containers:
  - name: apache-container
    image: httpd:2.4
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
EOF
Apply the YAML manifest:
kubectl apply -f apache-pod.yaml
Verify both pods are running:
kubectl get pods -o wide
Subtask 3.3: Exploring Pod Details and Logs
Check pod logs:
kubectl logs nginx-pod
kubectl logs apache-pod
Follow logs in real-time:
kubectl logs -f nginx-pod
Press Ctrl+C to stop following logs.

Execute commands inside a pod:
kubectl exec -it nginx-pod -- /bin/bash
Inside the pod, run:

ps aux
exit
Get pod resource usage:
kubectl top pods
Subtask 3.4: Working with Labels and Selectors
View pod labels:
kubectl get pods --show-labels
Add labels to existing pod:
kubectl label pod nginx-pod version=v1.0
Filter pods by labels:
kubectl get pods -l app=apache
kubectl get pods -l environment=lab
Remove a label:
kubectl label pod nginx-pod version-
Subtask 3.5: OpenShift-Specific Features
Create an OpenShift project (enhanced namespace):
oc new-project openshift-demo --display-name="OpenShift Demo Project"
Switch to the new project:
oc project openshift-demo
Create an application using oc new-app:
oc new-app --name=hello-world --docker-image=quay.io/redhattraining/hello-world-nginx:v1.0
Check the created resources:
oc get all
Expose the service as a route (OpenShift-specific):
oc expose service hello-world
Get the route URL:
oc get routes
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: Pod Stuck in Pending State
Symptoms: Pod shows status as "Pending"

Diagnosis:

kubectl describe pod [pod-name]
Common Solutions: • Check if there are sufficient resources on nodes • Verify image name and availability • Check namespace resource quotas

Issue 2: Authentication Problems
Symptoms: "Unauthorized" or "Forbidden" errors

Solutions:

# Re-authenticate
oc login --server=https://your-cluster-url:6443

# Check current user
oc whoami

# Verify permissions
oc auth can-i create pods
Issue 3: Command Not Found
Symptoms: "kubectl: command not found" or "oc: command not found"

Solutions:

# Check if tools are in PATH
which kubectl
which oc

# If not found, they should be pre-installed in your lab environment
# Contact support if tools are missing
Lab Cleanup
Before ending the lab, clean up the resources you created:

Delete pods:
kubectl delete pod nginx-pod
kubectl delete pod apache-pod
Delete namespaces:
kubectl delete namespace lab-demo
Delete OpenShift project:
oc delete project openshift-demo
Verify cleanup:
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep -E "(nginx-pod|apache-pod)"
Conclusion
In this lab, you have successfully:

• Set up and accessed an OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster environment • Learned essential commands using both kubectl and oc CLI tools • Created and managed namespaces to organize cluster resources • Deployed and explored pods using both imperative and declarative approaches • Worked with labels and selectors for resource organization and filtering • Experienced OpenShift-specific features like projects and routes • Applied troubleshooting techniques for common cluster issues

Why This Matters: Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for anyone working with container orchestration platforms. OpenShift and Kubernetes are widely used in enterprise environments for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. The skills you've learned today form the foundation for more advanced topics like deployments, services, persistent storage, and cluster administration.

Next Steps: In future labs, you'll build upon these basics to explore more complex scenarios including application deployments, service networking, persistent volumes, and advanced OpenShift features like builds and image streams.

The hands-on experience gained in this lab provides practical knowledge that directly applies to real-world container orchestration scenarios and prepares you for advanced OpenShift administration tasks.
