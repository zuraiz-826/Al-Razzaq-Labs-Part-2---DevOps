Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, you should have:

• Basic understanding of containerization concepts • Familiarity with YAML syntax and structure • Basic knowledge of Linux command-line operations • Understanding of Kubernetes/OpenShift fundamental concepts (pods, deployments, services) • Access to a terminal or command-line interface

Lab Environment Setup
Ready-to-Use Cloud Machines: Al Nafi provides pre-configured Linux-based cloud machines with all necessary tools installed. Simply click Start Lab to access your environment - no need to build your own VM or install additional software.

Your lab environment includes: • OpenShift CLI (oc) pre-installed • kubectl command-line tool • Text editor (nano/vim) • Access to an OpenShift cluster

Task 1: Create a YAML Manifest for a Deployment
Subtask 1.1: Understanding Deployment Manifest Structure
A Deployment manifest is a YAML file that describes the desired state of your application deployment. It includes specifications for replicas, container images, resource limits, and other configuration details.

Key components of a Deployment manifest: • apiVersion: Specifies the API version • kind: Defines the resource type (Deployment) • metadata: Contains name, labels, and annotations • spec: Describes the desired state of the deployment

Subtask 1.2: Create the Deployment Manifest File
Open your terminal in the lab environment

Create a new directory for your lab files:

mkdir ~/lab2-manifests
cd ~/lab2-manifests
Create a new YAML file for your deployment:
nano nginx-deployment.yaml
Copy and paste the following complete deployment manifest:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
    environment: lab
    version: v1.0
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
        environment: lab
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
        env:
        - name: NGINX_PORT
          value: "80"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
Save the file by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter
Subtask 1.3: Validate the Manifest Syntax
Verify the YAML syntax is correct:
oc apply --dry-run=client -f nginx-deployment.yaml
If successful, you should see output similar to:
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created (dry run)
Task 2: Apply the Manifest Using kubectl or oc
Subtask 2.1: Apply the Deployment Manifest
Apply the manifest to create the deployment:
oc apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
Verify the deployment was created successfully:
oc get deployments
Expected output:

NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           30s
Subtask 2.2: Verify Pod Creation
Check that pods were created by the deployment:
oc get pods -l app=nginx
You should see three nginx pods running:
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-7d8c4c8d4f-abc12   1/1     Running   0          45s
nginx-deployment-7d8c4c8d4f-def34   1/1     Running   0          45s
nginx-deployment-7d8c4c8d4f-ghi56   1/1     Running   0          45s
Subtask 2.3: View Detailed Deployment Information
Get detailed information about the deployment:
oc describe deployment nginx-deployment
Review the output to understand: • Deployment strategy • Replica set information • Pod template details • Events and status
Task 3: Inspect the Deployment's Status and Logs
Subtask 3.1: Monitor Deployment Status
Check the current status of your deployment:
oc get deployment nginx-deployment -o wide
Monitor the rollout status:
oc rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
View the replica set created by the deployment:
oc get replicasets -l app=nginx
Subtask 3.2: Examine Pod Logs
Get the name of one of your nginx pods:
POD_NAME=$(oc get pods -l app=nginx -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
echo $POD_NAME
View the logs from the nginx container:
oc logs $POD_NAME
Follow the logs in real-time (optional):
oc logs -f $POD_NAME
Press Ctrl + C to stop following logs.

Subtask 3.3: Test Application Functionality
Create a temporary pod to test connectivity:
oc run test-pod --image=curlimages/curl --rm -it --restart=Never -- sh
From inside the test pod, test one of your nginx pods:
# Get the IP of one nginx pod first
exit
Get a pod IP and test connectivity:
POD_IP=$(oc get pod $POD_NAME -o jsonpath='{.status.podIP}')
echo "Testing connectivity to pod IP: $POD_IP"

oc run test-pod --image=curlimages/curl --rm -it --restart=Never -- curl -s http://$POD_IP
You should see the default nginx welcome page HTML.

Subtask 3.4: Advanced Status Inspection
View deployment events:
oc get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=nginx-deployment
Check resource usage:
oc top pods -l app=nginx
View the deployment in JSON format for detailed analysis:
oc get deployment nginx-deployment -o json | jq '.status'
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: Pods Not Starting
If pods are not starting, check:

oc describe pod $POD_NAME
Look for events at the bottom of the output.

Issue 2: Image Pull Errors
Verify the image name and tag:

oc get pods -l app=nginx
oc describe pod $POD_NAME
Issue 3: Resource Constraints
Check if resource limits are too restrictive:

oc describe nodes
oc get pods -l app=nginx -o wide
Cleanup
To clean up the resources created in this lab:

Delete the deployment:
oc delete deployment nginx-deployment
Verify cleanup:
oc get deployments
oc get pods -l app=nginx
Remove the lab directory:
cd ~
rm -rf lab2-manifests
Conclusion
In this lab, you have successfully:

• Created a comprehensive YAML manifest for a Deployment with proper resource specifications, health checks, and environment configuration • Applied the manifest to an OpenShift cluster using the oc command-line tool • Inspected deployment status using various kubectl/oc commands to understand the deployment lifecycle • Analyzed application logs to verify successful deployment and troubleshoot potential issues • Tested application functionality to ensure the deployed services are working correctly

Why This Matters: Understanding resource manifests is fundamental to managing applications in Kubernetes and OpenShift environments. Manifests provide a declarative way to define your application's desired state, making deployments reproducible, version-controlled, and easily manageable. This knowledge is essential for the Red Hat OpenShift Administration II certification and real-world container orchestration scenarios.

The skills you've learned here form the foundation for more advanced topics like rolling updates, scaling strategies, and complex multi-service applications. Mastering manifest creation and management is crucial for maintaining production-ready containerized applications.
