Task 1: Create a Kustomize Base with Deployment Manifest
Subtask 1.1: Set Up the Project Structure
First, let's create the directory structure for our Kustomize project.

# Create the main project directory
mkdir kustomize-lab
cd kustomize-lab

# Create base directory
mkdir base

# Create overlay directories for different environments
mkdir -p overlays/dev
mkdir -p overlays/prod

# Verify the directory structure

Task 3: Apply the Kustomize Configuration Using kubectl
Subtask 3.1: Preview the Generated Configurations
Before applying the configurations, let's preview what Kustomize will generate for each environment.

Preview the development configuration:

kubectl kustomize overlays/dev
This command shows the complete YAML that would be applied to the cluster. Review the output to see how the base configuration has been modified with development-specific settings.

Preview the production configuration:

kubectl kustomize overlays/prod
Compare the differences between dev and prod configurations, noting: • Different replica counts • Different resource limits • Different environment variables • Different service types

Subtask 3.2: Create Namespaces
Create the required namespaces for our environments:

kubectl create namespace webapp-dev
kubectl create namespace webapp-prod
Verify the namespaces were created:

kubectl get namespaces | grep webapp
Subtask 3.3: Apply the Development Configuration
Apply the development overlay to the cluster:

kubectl apply -k overlays/dev
Expected output:

configmap/dev-webapp-config created
service/dev-webapp-service created
deployment.apps/dev-webapp created
Verify the development deployment:

kubectl get all -n webapp-dev
Check the deployment details:

kubectl describe deployment dev-webapp -n webapp-dev
Subtask 3.4: Apply the Production Configuration
Apply the production overlay to the cluster:

kubectl apply -k overlays/prod
Expected output:

configmap/prod-webapp-config created
service/prod-webapp-service created
deployment.apps/prod-webapp created
Verify the production deployment:

kubectl get all -n webapp-prod
Check the production deployment details:

kubectl describe deployment prod-webapp -n webapp-prod
Subtask 3.5: Compare Environment Configurations
Compare the running configurations between environments:

# Check replica counts
echo "Development replicas:"
kubectl get deployment dev-webapp -n webapp-dev -o jsonpath='{.spec.replicas}'
echo ""

echo "Production replicas:"
kubectl get deployment prod-webapp -n webapp-prod -o jsonpath='{.spec.replicas}'
echo ""

# Check environment variables
echo "Development environment variables:"
kubectl get deployment dev-webapp -n webapp-dev -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env}'
echo ""

echo "Production environment variables:"
kubectl get deployment prod-webapp -n webapp-prod -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env}'
echo ""
Subtask 3.6: Test Configuration Updates
Let's test updating configurations through Kustomize. Modify the development replica count:

cd overlays/dev
Edit the deployment patch to change replica count:

cat > deployment-patch.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: nginx:1.21-alpine
        env:
        - name: ENVIRONMENT
          value: "development"
        - name: DEBUG
          value: "true"
        - name: VERSION
          value: "v1.1.0"
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "32Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
EOF
Apply the updated configuration:

cd ../../
kubectl apply -k overlays/dev
Verify the changes:

kubectl get deployment dev-webapp -n webapp-dev
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: Kustomization File Not Found
Problem: Error message "unable to find one of 'kustomization.yaml', 'kustomization.yml' or 'Kustomization'"

Solution:

# Ensure you're in the correct directory
pwd
ls -la

# Check for the kustomization file
ls kustomization.yaml
Issue 2: Resource Not Found in Base
Problem: Error about resources not being found in the base directory

Solution:

# Verify the base directory structure
ls -la base/

# Check the base kustomization file
cat base/kustomization.yaml
Issue 3: Namespace Issues
Problem: Resources being created in the wrong namespace

Solution:

# Check the namespace specification in overlay kustomization
grep -n namespace overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml

# Ensure namespace exists
kubectl get namespace webapp-dev
Issue 4: Patch Not Applied
Problem: Strategic merge patches not being applied correctly

Solution:

# Preview the configuration to see if patches are applied
kubectl kustomize overlays/dev

# Check patch file syntax
cat overlays/dev/deployment-patch.yaml
Verification and Testing
Verify Resource Labels and Annotations
Check that common labels and annotations are applied:

# Check development resources
kubectl get deployment dev-webapp -n webapp-dev --show-labels

# Check production resources
kubectl get deployment prod-webapp -n webapp-prod --show-labels
Test Application Functionality
Port-forward to test the applications:

# Test development application
kubectl port-forward deployment/dev-webapp 8080:80 -n webapp-dev &

# Test in another terminal
curl http://localhost:8080

# Stop port-forward
pkill -f "kubectl port-forward"

# Test production application
kubectl port-forward deployment/prod-webapp 8081:80 -n webapp-prod &

# Test in another terminal
curl http://localhost:8081

# Stop port-forward
pkill -f "kubectl port-forward"
Cleanup
To clean up the resources created in this lab:

# Delete development resources
kubectl delete -k overlays/dev

# Delete production resources
kubectl delete -k overlays/prod

# Delete namespaces
kubectl delete namespace webapp-dev
kubectl delete namespace webapp-prod

# Clean up local files
cd ..
rm -rf kustomize-lab
Conclusion
In this lab, you have successfully:

• Created a Kustomize base configuration with deployment and service manifests that serve as the foundation for multiple environments • Developed environment-specific overlays for development and production environments, demonstrating how to customize configurations without duplicating code • Applied Kustomize configurations using kubectl, showing the practical implementation of configuration management • Implemented configuration inheritance patterns that allow for efficient management of multiple environments • Used strategic merge patches to modify specific aspects of base configurations for different environments • Managed environment-specific variables and resource requirements through overlays

Why This Matters: Kustomize provides a powerful, declarative way to manage Kubernetes configurations across multiple environments without the complexity of templating engines. This approach:

• Reduces Configuration Drift: Ensures consistency across environments while allowing necessary customizations • Improves Maintainability: Changes to base configurations automatically propagate to all environments • Enhances Security: Environment-specific secrets and configurations can be managed separately • Supports GitOps Workflows: Kustomize integrations work seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines and GitOps tools like ArgoCD • Simplifies Compliance: Standardized base configurations help maintain compliance requirements across environments

This knowledge is essential for Red Hat OpenShift Administration and modern Kubernetes operations, where managing multiple environments efficiently and safely is crucial for production
