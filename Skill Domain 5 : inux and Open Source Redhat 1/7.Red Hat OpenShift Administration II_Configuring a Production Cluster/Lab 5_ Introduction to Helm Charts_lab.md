Lab 5: Introduction to Helm Charts
Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

• Understand what Helm is and its role in Kubernetes package management • Install and configure Helm on a Kubernetes cluster • Create a custom Helm chart with parameterized deployments • Use Helm templates and values files to manage application configurations • Deploy applications using Helm charts to a Kubernetes cluster • Manage Helm releases and perform basic operations like upgrade and rollback

Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, you should have:

• Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts (pods, deployments, services) • Familiarity with YAML syntax and structure • Experience with command-line interface operations • Knowledge of container concepts and Docker basics • Access to a Kubernetes cluster with kubectl configured

Lab Environment
Ready-to-Use Cloud Machines: Al Nafi provides pre-configured Linux-based cloud machines with Kubernetes clusters already set up. Simply click Start Lab to access your environment - no need to build your own VM or configure Kubernetes from scratch.

Your lab environment includes: • A running Kubernetes cluster with multiple nodes • kubectl pre-installed and configured • Internet access for downloading Helm and other resources • Administrative privileges on the control node

Task 1: Install Helm on the Control Node
Subtask 1.1: Download and Install Helm
First, we'll install Helm, which is the package manager for Kubernetes that helps us manage complex applications.

Connect to your control node and verify your Kubernetes cluster is running:
kubectl get nodes
Download the latest Helm installation script:
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
Make the script executable and run it:
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
Verify Helm installation:
helm version
You should see output showing the Helm version information.

Subtask 1.2: Initialize Helm Repository
Add the official Helm stable repository:
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
Add the Bitnami repository (popular for production-ready charts):
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
Update your local repository cache:
helm repo update
List available repositories:
helm repo list
Subtask 1.3: Explore Helm Commands
Search for available charts:
helm search repo nginx
Get help on Helm commands:
helm help
Task 2: Create a Simple Helm Chart with Parameterized Deployment
Subtask 2.1: Generate a New Helm Chart
Create a new directory for your Helm work:
mkdir ~/helm-lab
cd ~/helm-lab
Generate a new Helm chart called 'webapp':
helm create webapp
Explore the generated chart structure:
ls -la webapp/
tree webapp/
The structure includes: • Chart.yaml: Metadata about the chart • values.yaml: Default configuration values • templates/: Directory containing Kubernetes manifest templates • charts/: Directory for chart dependencies

Subtask 2.2: Examine the Default Chart Files
View the Chart.yaml file:
cat webapp/Chart.yaml
Examine the default values.yaml:
cat webapp/values.yaml
Look at the deployment template:
cat webapp/templates/deployment.yaml
Notice how the template uses {{ .Values. }}* syntax to reference values from the values.yaml file.

Subtask 2.3: Customize the Chart for Our Web Application
Edit the values.yaml file to customize our application:
nano webapp/values.yaml
Replace the content with:

# Default values for webapp
replicaCount: 2

image:
  repository: nginx
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tag: "1.21"

nameOverride: ""
fullnameOverride: ""

service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 80

ingress:
  enabled: false

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi

nodeSelector: {}

tolerations: []

affinity: {}

# Custom values for our webapp
app:
  name: "My Web Application"
  environment: "development"
  debug: true
Create a custom ConfigMap template for application configuration:
nano webapp/templates/configmap.yaml
Add the following content:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ include "webapp.fullname" . }}-config
  labels:
    {{- include "webapp.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
data:
  app-name: {{ .Values.app.name | quote }}
  environment: {{ .Values.app.environment | quote }}
  debug: {{ .Values.app.debug | quote }}
  nginx.conf: |
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;
        location / {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index index.html index.htm;
        }
        location /health {
            access_log off;
            return 200 "healthy\n";
            add_header Content-Type text/plain;
        }
    }
Modify the deployment template to use our ConfigMap:
nano webapp/templates/deployment.yaml
Find the containers section and add environment variables and volume mounts:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ include "webapp.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "webapp.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
spec:
  {{- if not .Values.autoscaling.enabled }}
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
  {{- end }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      {{- include "webapp.selectorLabels" . | nindent 6 }}
  template:
    metadata:
      {{- with .Values.podAnnotations }}
      annotations:
        {{- toYaml . | nindent 8 }}
      {{- end }}
      labels:
        {{- include "webapp.selectorLabels" . | nindent 8 }}
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
          image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag | default .Chart.AppVersion }}"
          imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
          env:
            - name: APP_NAME
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: {{ include "webapp.fullname" . }}-config
                  key: app-name
            - name: ENVIRONMENT
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: {{ include "webapp.fullname" . }}-config
                  key: environment
            - name: DEBUG
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: {{ include "webapp.fullname" . }}-config
                  key: debug
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: http
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 10
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: http
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 5
          resources:
            {{- toYaml .Values.resources | nindent 12 }}
          volumeMounts:
            - name: nginx-config
              mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d
              readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: nginx-config
          configMap:
            name: {{ include "webapp.fullname" . }}-config
            items:
              - key: nginx.conf
                path: default.conf
Subtask 2.4: Validate the Chart
Lint the chart to check for issues:
helm lint webapp/
Render the templates to see the final Kubernetes manifests:
helm template webapp webapp/
Dry-run the installation to validate without deploying:
helm install webapp-test webapp/ --dry-run --debug
Task 3: Deploy the Chart to the Cluster
Subtask 3.1: Deploy the Chart with Default Values
Install the chart to your Kubernetes cluster:
helm install my-webapp webapp/
Check the installation status:
helm status my-webapp
List all Helm releases:
helm list
Verify the deployed resources:
kubectl get all -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-webapp
Check the ConfigMap:
kubectl get configmap
kubectl describe configmap my-webapp-config
Subtask 3.2: Test the Application
Get the service information:
kubectl get svc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-webapp
Port-forward to access the application:
kubectl port-forward svc/my-webapp 8080:80 &
Test the application (in a new terminal or background the port-forward):
curl http://localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/health
Stop the port-forward:
pkill -f "kubectl port-forward"
Subtask 3.3: Upgrade the Chart with New Values
Create a custom values file for production:
nano production-values.yaml
Add the following content:

replicaCount: 3

image:
  tag: "1.22"

app:
  name: "Production Web Application"
  environment: "production"
  debug: false

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 256Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 150m
    memory: 192Mi
Upgrade the release with new values:
helm upgrade my-webapp webapp/ -f production-values.yaml
Check the upgrade status:
helm status my-webapp
Verify the changes:
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-webapp
kubectl describe configmap my-webapp-config
Subtask 3.4: Manage Helm Releases
View release history:
helm history my-webapp
Rollback to previous version (if needed):
helm rollback my-webapp 1
Get values from the current release:
helm get values my-webapp
Get all information about the release:
helm get all my-webapp
Subtask 3.5: Package and Share the Chart
Package the chart into a .tgz file:
helm package webapp/
List the packaged chart:
ls -la *.tgz
Install from the packaged chart:
helm install test-webapp webapp-0.1.0.tgz --set replicaCount=1
Clean up the test installation:
helm uninstall test-webapp
Troubleshooting Tips
Common Issues and Solutions
Issue: Helm command not found after installation Solution: Restart your terminal session or run source ~/.bashrc

Issue: Chart validation fails during lint Solution: Check YAML indentation and ensure all template variables are properly defined in values.yaml

Issue: Pods fail to start after deployment Solution: Check pod logs with kubectl logs <pod-name> and verify resource limits and image availability

Issue: ConfigMap not mounting correctly Solution: Verify the ConfigMap exists and the volume mount paths are correct in the deployment template

Issue: Port-forward connection refused Solution: Ensure the service is running and the port numbers match between the service and port-forward command

Verification Commands
Use these commands to verify your deployment:

# Check all resources created by Helm
kubectl get all -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm

# Verify Helm release status
helm status my-webapp

# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-webapp
Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Introduction to Helm Charts lab. Here's what you accomplished:

Key Achievements: • Installed Helm: You set up Helm 3 on your Kubernetes cluster and configured repositories • Created a Custom Chart: You built a parameterized Helm chart with templates, values, and ConfigMaps • Deployed Applications: You successfully deployed and managed applications using Helm charts • Managed Releases: You learned to upgrade, rollback, and manage Helm releases effectively • Parameterized Configurations: You created flexible charts that can be customized for different environments

Why This Matters: Helm is essential for managing complex Kubernetes applications in production environments. It provides: • Package Management: Simplifies application deployment and dependency management • Configuration Management: Enables environment-specific configurations without changing code • Release Management: Provides versioning, rollback capabilities, and deployment history • Reusability: Charts can be shared and reused across teams and projects • Standardization: Promotes consistent deployment practices across organizations

Next Steps: • Explore advanced Helm features like chart dependencies and hooks • Learn about Helm repositories and chart distribution • Practice creating charts for more complex applications with databases and services • Investigate Helm security best practices and chart signing • Study integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments

This lab has provided you with the foundational skills needed for the Red Hat OpenShift Administration II certification and real-world Kubernetes application management using open-source tools.
