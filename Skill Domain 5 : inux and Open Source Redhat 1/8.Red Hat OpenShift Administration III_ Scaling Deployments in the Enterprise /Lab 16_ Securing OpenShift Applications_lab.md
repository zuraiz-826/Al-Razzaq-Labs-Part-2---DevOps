Lab Environment Setup
Task 0: Verify Lab Environment
Before beginning the main tasks, let's verify our lab environment is ready.

Subtask 0.1: Check OpenShift Cluster Access
Open a terminal in your cloud machine
Verify you're logged into the OpenShift cluster:
oc whoami
oc cluster-info
Check your current project:
oc project
If no project is set, create a new project for this lab:
oc new-project security-lab
Subtask 0.2: Examine Default Security Context Constraints
List all available SCCs in the cluster:
oc get scc
Examine the details of the default restricted SCC:
oc describe scc restricted
View the privileged SCC for comparison:
oc describe scc privileged
Task 1: Create and Apply a Custom SCC for Privileged Workloads
Security Context Constraints (SCCs) control the security context under which pods run. In this task, we'll create a custom SCC that allows specific privileged operations while maintaining security.

Subtask 1.1: Design the Custom SCC
Create a directory for our lab files:
mkdir ~/security-lab
cd ~/security-lab
Create a custom SCC configuration file:
cat > custom-privileged-scc.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  name: custom-privileged-scc
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/description: "Custom SCC for privileged workloads with specific capabilities"
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowHostIPC: false
allowHostNetwork: false
allowHostPID: false
allowHostPorts: false
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
allowedCapabilities:
- SYS_ADMIN
- NET_ADMIN
- SYS_TIME
defaultAddCapabilities: []
fsGroup:
  type: RunAsAny
priority: 10
readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
requiredDropCapabilities:
- KILL
- MKNOD
- SETUID
- SETGID
runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny
seLinuxContext:
  type: MustRunAs
supplementalGroups:
  type: RunAsAny
users: []
groups: []
volumes:
- configMap
- downwardAPI
- emptyDir
- hostPath
- persistentVolumeClaim
- projected
- secret
EOF
Subtask 1.2: Apply the Custom SCC
Apply the custom SCC to the cluster:
oc apply -f custom-privileged-scc.yaml
Verify the SCC was created successfully:
oc get scc custom-privileged-scc
Examine the details of your custom SCC:
oc describe scc custom-privileged-scc
Subtask 1.3: Create a Moderate Security SCC
Let's also create a moderate security SCC for comparison:

Create a moderate security SCC:
cat > moderate-security-scc.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  name: moderate-security-scc
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/description: "Moderate security SCC with limited privileges"
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false
allowHostIPC: false
allowHostNetwork: false
allowHostPID: false
allowHostPorts: false
allowPrivilegedContainer: false
allowedCapabilities:
- NET_BIND_SERVICE
defaultAddCapabilities: []
fsGroup:
  type: MustRunAs
  ranges:
  - min: 1000
    max: 65535
priority: 5
readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
requiredDropCapabilities:
- ALL
runAsUser:
  type: MustRunAsNonRoot
seLinuxContext:
  type: MustRunAs
supplementalGroups:
  type: MustRunAs
  ranges:
  - min: 1000
    max: 65535
users: []
groups: []
volumes:
- configMap
- downwardAPI
- emptyDir
- persistentVolumeClaim
- projected
- secret
EOF
Apply the moderate security SCC:
oc apply -f moderate-security-scc.yaml
Verify both custom SCCs exist:
oc get scc | grep -E "(custom-privileged|moderate-security)"
Task 2: Assign SCC to Service Accounts
Service accounts are used to control which SCCs pods can use. In this task, we'll create service accounts and assign our custom SCCs to them.

Subtask 2.1: Create Service Accounts
Create a service account for privileged workloads:
oc create serviceaccount privileged-sa
Create a service account for moderate security workloads:
oc create serviceaccount moderate-sa
Create a service account for restricted workloads:
oc create serviceaccount restricted-sa
Verify the service accounts were created:
oc get serviceaccounts
Subtask 2.2: Assign SCCs to Service Accounts
Add the privileged service account to the custom privileged SCC:
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user custom-privileged-scc -z privileged-sa
Add the moderate service account to the moderate security SCC:
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user moderate-security-scc -z moderate-sa
The restricted service account will use the default restricted SCC (no action needed)

Verify the SCC assignments:

oc describe scc custom-privileged-scc | grep -A 10 Users
oc describe scc moderate-security-scc | grep -A 10 Users
Subtask 2.3: Create Role-Based Access Control
Create a role that allows using specific SCCs:
cat > scc-role.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: scc-user
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - security.openshift.io
  resources:
  - securitycontextconstraints
  verbs:
  - use
  resourceNames:
  - custom-privileged-scc
  - moderate-security-scc
  - restricted
EOF
Apply the role:
oc apply -f scc-role.yaml
Bind the role to our service accounts:
oc create rolebinding privileged-sa-binding --role=scc-user --serviceaccount=security-lab:privileged-sa
oc create rolebinding moderate-sa-binding --role=scc-user --serviceaccount=security-lab:moderate-sa
oc create rolebinding restricted-sa-binding --role=scc-user --serviceaccount=security-lab:restricted-sa
Task 3: Test Security Configurations by Deploying Pods with Different SCCs
Now we'll test our security configurations by deploying pods with different security requirements and observing how SCCs affect their behavior.

Subtask 3.1: Deploy a Privileged Pod
Create a privileged pod configuration:
cat > privileged-pod.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: privileged-test-pod
  labels:
    app: privileged-test
spec:
  serviceAccountName: privileged-sa
  containers:
  - name: privileged-container
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do echo 'Privileged pod running...'; sleep 30; done"]
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
      capabilities:
        add:
        - SYS_ADMIN
        - NET_ADMIN
    volumeMounts:
    - name: host-root
      mountPath: /host
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: host-root
    hostPath:
      path: /
      type: Directory
  restartPolicy: Never
EOF
Deploy the privileged pod:
oc apply -f privileged-pod.yaml
Check the pod status:
oc get pods privileged-test-pod
Verify which SCC was assigned:
oc get pod privileged-test-pod -o yaml | grep "openshift.io/scc"
Subtask 3.2: Deploy a Moderate Security Pod
Create a moderate security pod configuration:
cat > moderate-pod.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: moderate-test-pod
  labels:
    app: moderate-test
spec:
  serviceAccountName: moderate-sa
  containers:
  - name: moderate-container
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do echo 'Moderate security pod running...'; sleep 30; done"]
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 1001
      capabilities:
        add:
        - NET_BIND_SERVICE
        drop:
        - ALL
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
  restartPolicy: Never
EOF
Deploy the moderate security pod:
oc apply -f moderate-pod.yaml
Check the pod status:
oc get pods moderate-test-pod
Verify the assigned SCC:
oc get pod moderate-test-pod -o yaml | grep "openshift.io/scc"
Subtask 3.3: Deploy a Restricted Pod
Create a restricted pod configuration:
cat > restricted-pod.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: restricted-test-pod
  labels:
    app: restricted-test
spec:
  serviceAccountName: restricted-sa
  containers:
  - name: restricted-container
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do echo 'Restricted pod running...'; sleep 30; done"]
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
  restartPolicy: Never
EOF
Deploy the restricted pod:
oc apply -f restricted-pod.yaml
Check the pod status:
oc get pods restricted-test-pod
Verify the assigned SCC:
oc get pod restricted-test-pod -o yaml | grep "openshift.io/scc"
Subtask 3.4: Test Security Violations
Let's test what happens when we try to deploy a pod that violates security constraints.

Create a pod that attempts to use privileged features with a restricted service account:
cat > violation-test-pod.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: violation-test-pod
  labels:
    app: violation-test
spec:
  serviceAccountName: restricted-sa
  containers:
  - name: violation-container
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do echo 'This should fail...'; sleep 30; done"]
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
      runAsUser: 0
  restartPolicy: Never
EOF
Attempt to deploy this pod:
oc apply -f violation-test-pod.yaml
Check if the pod was created and its status:
oc get pods violation-test-pod
oc describe pod violation-test-pod
The pod should fail to start due to security constraint violations.

Subtask 3.5: Verify Pod Security Contexts
Check all running pods and their assigned SCCs:
oc get pods -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,SCC:.metadata.annotations."openshift\.io/scc",STATUS:.status.phase
Examine the security context of the privileged pod:
oc exec privileged-test-pod -- id
oc exec privileged-test-pod -- ls -la /host
Examine the security context of the moderate security pod:
oc exec moderate-test-pod -- id
oc exec moderate-test-pod -- whoami
Examine the security context of the restricted pod:
oc exec restricted-test-pod -- id
oc exec restricted-test-pod -- whoami
Subtask 3.6: Test Capability Differences
Test privileged capabilities in the privileged pod:
oc exec privileged-test-pod -- capsh --print
Test capabilities in the moderate security pod:
oc exec moderate-test-pod -- capsh --print
Test capabilities in the restricted pod:
oc exec restricted-test-pod -- capsh --print
Compare the output to see the differences in granted capabilities.

Task 4: Advanced Security Testing and Monitoring
Subtask 4.1: Create a Deployment with Security Constraints
Create a deployment that uses our custom SCC:
cat > secure-deployment.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: secure-app-deployment
  labels:
    app: secure-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: secure-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: secure-app
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: moderate-sa
      containers:
      - name: secure-app
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
        command: ["/bin/bash"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do echo 'Secure app running on pod:' $(hostname); sleep 60; done"]
        securityContext:
          runAsNonRoot: true
          runAsUser: 1001
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - ALL
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "50m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
EOF
Deploy the secure application:
oc apply -f secure-deployment.yaml
Verify the deployment:
oc get deployment secure-app-deployment
oc get pods -l app=secure-app
Subtask 4.2: Monitor Security Events
Check for security-related events:
oc get events --field-selector reason=FailedCreate
oc get events --field-selector reason=SecurityContextConstraintsAdmission
View logs from our test pods:
oc logs privileged-test-pod --tail=5
oc logs moderate-test-pod --tail=5
oc logs restricted-test-pod --tail=5
Subtask 4.3: Security Audit and Cleanup
List all SCCs and their users:
echo "=== Custom Privileged SCC ==="
oc describe scc custom-privileged-scc | grep -A 20 "Users:"

echo "=== Moderate Security SCC ==="
oc describe scc moderate-security-scc | grep -A 20 "Users:"
Check which pods are using which SCCs:
oc get pods -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,SCC:.metadata.annotations."openshift\.io/scc",SA:.spec.serviceAccountName
Clean up test resources (optional):
# Delete test pods
oc delete pod privileged-test-pod moderate-test-pod restricted-test-pod violation-test-pod

# Delete deployment
oc delete deployment secure-app-deployment

# Keep SCCs and service accounts for reference
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: Pod Fails to Start Due to SCC Violations
Symptoms: Pod remains in Pending or CreateContainerConfigError state

Solution:

Check pod events:
oc describe pod <pod-name>
Verify service account has access to appropriate SCC:
oc describe scc <scc-name>
Check if the security context in the pod spec matches SCC requirements
Issue 2: Service Account Cannot Use SCC
Symptoms: Error messages about insufficient permissions

Solution:

Verify SCC assignment:
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user <scc-name> -z <service-account-name>
Check role bindings:
oc get rolebindings
Issue 3: Privileged Operations Fail
Symptoms: Operations requiring elevated privileges fail inside containers

Solution:

Verify the pod is using the correct SCC:
oc get pod <pod-name> -o yaml | grep "openshift.io/scc"
Check if required capabilities are granted in the SCC
Key Security Best Practices
• Principle of Least Privilege: Always use the most restrictive SCC that allows your application to function • Service Account Isolation: Create dedicated service accounts for different security requirements • Regular Auditing: Periodically review SCC assignments and usage • Capability Management: Only grant necessary capabilities, drop all others • Non-Root Execution: Run containers as non-root users whenever possible • Read-Only Filesystems: Use read-only root filesystems when applications don't need write access

Conclusion
In this lab, you have successfully:

• Created custom Security Context Constraints that balance security with functionality requirements • Assigned SCCs to service accounts to control pod security policies at the account level • Deployed and tested applications with different security configurations to understand SCC behavior • Identified security violations and learned how OpenShift prevents unauthorized privilege escalation • Implemented security monitoring to track and audit security-related events • Applied security best practices for containerized applications in OpenShift

Understanding and properly implementing Security Context Constraints is crucial for maintaining a secure OpenShift environment. SCCs provide fine-grained control over what security contexts pods can use, helping prevent privilege escalation attacks while allowing legitimate applications to function with necessary permissions.

The skills you've learned in this lab are essential for:

Enterprise Security Compliance: Meeting organizational security requirements
Multi-Tenant Environments: Isolating workloads with different security needs
Regulatory Compliance: Satisfying industry-specific security standards
Risk Management: Reducing the attack surface of containerized applications
These security practices form the foundation for running production workloads safely in OpenShift environments, making this knowledge invaluable for OpenShift administrators and security professionals.
