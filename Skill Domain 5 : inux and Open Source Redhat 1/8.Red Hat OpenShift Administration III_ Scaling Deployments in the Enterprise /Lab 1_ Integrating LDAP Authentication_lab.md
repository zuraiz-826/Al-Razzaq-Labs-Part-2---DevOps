Lab 1: Integrating LDAP Authentication
Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

• Configure LDAP Identity Provider (IdP) in OpenShift for centralized authentication • Map LDAP groups to OpenShift roles for proper authorization • Test LDAP authentication using the oc command-line interface • Understand the relationship between authentication and authorization in OpenShift • Troubleshoot common LDAP integration issues

Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, you should have:

• Basic understanding of OpenShift concepts (pods, services, routes) • Familiarity with Linux command line operations • Knowledge of LDAP directory structure and terminology • Understanding of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) concepts • Access to OpenShift cluster with cluster-admin privileges

Lab Environment
Al Nafi provides ready-to-use Linux-based cloud machines for this lab. Simply click Start Lab to access your pre-configured environment. No need to build your own VM or install additional software.

Your lab environment includes: • OpenShift cluster (version 4.12 or later) • Pre-configured LDAP server with sample users and groups • oc command-line tool • All necessary certificates and configuration files

Task 1: Set up LDAP Identity Provider (IdP) in OpenShift
Subtask 1.1: Verify Cluster Access and Current Authentication
First, let's verify that you have proper access to the OpenShift cluster and examine the current authentication configuration.

Login to OpenShift as cluster administrator:
oc login -u admin -p admin123 https://api.cluster.example.com:6443
Verify cluster access:
oc whoami
oc get nodes
Check current OAuth configuration:
oc get oauth cluster -o yaml
Subtask 1.2: Examine LDAP Server Configuration
Before configuring OpenShift, let's understand the LDAP server structure that's already set up in your environment.

View LDAP server details:
# LDAP server is running at ldap.example.com:389
# Base DN: dc=example,dc=com
# Users are located at: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
# Groups are located at: ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com
Test LDAP connectivity:
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://ldap.example.com:389 -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -w admin123 -b "dc=example,dc=com" "(objectClass=*)"
Subtask 1.3: Create LDAP Identity Provider Configuration
Now we'll create the LDAP identity provider configuration for OpenShift.

Create a secret for LDAP bind credentials:
oc create secret generic ldap-secret \
  --from-literal=bindPassword=admin123 \
  -n openshift-config
Create the LDAP identity provider configuration file:
cat > ldap-idp.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: ldap-provider
    mappingMethod: claim
    type: LDAP
    ldap:
      attributes:
        id:
        - dn
        email:
        - mail
        name:
        - cn
        preferredUsername:
        - uid
      bindDN: "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"
      bindPassword:
        name: ldap-secret
      ca:
        name: ""
      insecure: true
      url: "ldap://ldap.example.com:389/ou=users,dc=example,dc=com?uid"
EOF
Apply the LDAP configuration:
oc apply -f ldap-idp.yaml
Verify the configuration was applied:
oc get oauth cluster -o yaml | grep -A 20 identityProviders
Subtask 1.4: Wait for OAuth Pods to Restart
The OAuth configuration change will trigger a restart of the OAuth pods.

Monitor OAuth pod restart:
oc get pods -n openshift-authentication -w
Wait for all pods to be ready (this may take 2-3 minutes):
oc get pods -n openshift-authentication
Task 2: Map LDAP Groups to OpenShift Roles
Subtask 2.1: Examine Available LDAP Groups
Let's first examine what groups are available in our LDAP directory.

Query LDAP groups:
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://ldap.example.com:389 \
  -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -w admin123 \
  -b "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com" \
  "(objectClass=groupOfNames)" cn
Expected groups: • developers - Application developers • admins - System administrators • viewers - Read-only users

Subtask 2.2: Create Group Synchronization Configuration
We'll create a configuration to synchronize LDAP groups with OpenShift groups.

Create LDAP group sync configuration:
cat > ldap-group-sync.yaml << 'EOF'
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
url: ldap://ldap.example.com:389
bindDN: "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"
bindPassword: admin123
insecure: true
groupUIDNameMapping:
  "cn=developers,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": developers
  "cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": admins
  "cn=viewers,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": viewers
rfc2307:
  groupsQuery:
    baseDN: "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
    scope: sub
    derefAliases: never
    filter: (objectClass=groupOfNames)
    pageSize: 0
  groupUIDAttribute: dn
  groupNameAttributes: [ cn ]
  groupMembershipAttributes: [ member ]
  usersQuery:
    baseDN: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
    scope: sub
    derefAliases: never
    filter: (objectClass=inetOrgPerson)
    pageSize: 0
  userUIDAttribute: dn
  userNameAttributes: [ uid ]
  tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: false
  tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: false
EOF
Perform a dry-run to test the configuration:
oc adm groups sync --sync-config=ldap-group-sync.yaml --confirm=false
Synchronize the groups:
oc adm groups sync --sync-config=ldap-group-sync.yaml --confirm=true
Verify groups were created:
oc get groups
Subtask 2.3: Create Role Bindings for LDAP Groups
Now we'll map the synchronized groups to appropriate OpenShift roles.

Create cluster role binding for admins group:
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group cluster-admin admins
Create role binding for developers group (edit access to specific project):
# First create a project for developers
oc new-project development

# Grant edit access to developers group
oc adm policy add-role-to-group edit developers -n development
Create role binding for viewers group (view access):
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group view viewers
Verify role bindings:
oc get rolebindings -A | grep -E "(admins|developers|viewers)"
oc get clusterrolebindings | grep -E "(admins|developers|viewers)"
Task 3: Test LDAP Authentication with oc login
Subtask 3.1: Test Authentication with Different User Types
Now let's test the LDAP authentication with different types of users.

Test with an admin user:
# Logout current session
oc logout

# Login with LDAP admin user
oc login -u admin-user -p password123 https://api.cluster.example.com:6443

# Verify admin privileges
oc whoami
oc get nodes
Test with a developer user:
# Logout and login as developer
oc logout
oc login -u dev-user -p password123 https://api.cluster.example.com:6443

# Verify developer access
oc whoami
oc get projects
oc project development
oc get pods
Test with a viewer user:
# Logout and login as viewer
oc logout
oc login -u view-user -p password123 https://api.cluster.example.com:6443

# Verify view-only access
oc whoami
oc get pods --all-namespaces
# Try to create something (should fail)
oc new-project test-project
Subtask 3.2: Verify Group Membership and Permissions
Let's verify that users are properly associated with their LDAP groups.

Check user identity and group membership:
# Login as admin to check user details
oc login -u admin -p admin123

# Check identities
oc get identities

# Check user group associations
oc get users
oc describe user dev-user
Test project-specific permissions:
# Login as developer
oc login -u dev-user -p password123

# Try to access development project
oc project development
oc run test-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never

# Try to access other projects (should be limited)
oc get pods -n openshift-authentication
Subtask 3.3: Test Group Synchronization Updates
Let's test what happens when we update group membership in LDAP.

Re-synchronize groups to pick up any changes:
# Login as admin
oc login -u admin -p admin123

# Re-run group sync
oc adm groups sync --sync-config=ldap-group-sync.yaml --confirm=true
Verify updated group memberships:
oc get groups -o yaml
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: LDAP Connection Problems
If you encounter LDAP connection issues:

# Test LDAP connectivity
telnet ldap.example.com 389

# Check LDAP server logs
oc logs -n openshift-authentication deployment/oauth-openshift
Issue 2: Authentication Failures
If users cannot authenticate:

# Check OAuth pod logs
oc logs -n openshift-authentication -l app=oauth-openshift

# Verify LDAP secret
oc get secret ldap-secret -n openshift-config -o yaml
Issue 3: Group Sync Issues
If group synchronization fails:

# Test group sync with verbose output
oc adm groups sync --sync-config=ldap-group-sync.yaml --confirm=false -v=5

# Check for LDAP query issues
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://ldap.example.com:389 -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -w admin123 -b "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com" -v
Verification Commands
Use these commands to verify your lab completion:

# Verify LDAP IdP configuration
oc get oauth cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.identityProviders[*].name}'

# Verify groups exist
oc get groups

# Verify role bindings
oc get clusterrolebindings | grep -E "(admins|viewers)"
oc get rolebindings -n development | grep developers

# Test authentication
oc login -u dev-user -p password123
oc whoami
oc logout
Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the LDAP Authentication Integration lab. Here's what you accomplished:

Key Achievements: • Configured LDAP Identity Provider - You set up OpenShift to authenticate users against an external LDAP directory, enabling centralized user management • Implemented Group Mapping - You synchronized LDAP groups with OpenShift groups and mapped them to appropriate roles, establishing proper authorization • Tested Authentication Flow - You verified that users can successfully authenticate using their LDAP credentials and access resources based on their group membership

Why This Matters: In enterprise environments, organizations typically have existing LDAP directories (like Active Directory) containing user accounts and group memberships. By integrating OpenShift with LDAP, you enable: • Single Sign-On Experience - Users can use their existing corporate credentials • Centralized User Management - IT administrators can manage access through existing directory services • Scalable Authorization - Group-based permissions scale better than individual user management • Security Compliance - Leverages existing security policies and audit trails

Real-World Applications: This configuration is essential for production OpenShift deployments in enterprises where hundreds or thousands of users need access to the platform. The group-based role mapping ensures that developers, administrators, and other stakeholders have appropriate access levels without manual user management overhead.

You now have the foundational knowledge to implement LDAP authentication in production OpenShift environments, making the platform more accessible and manageable for large organizations.
