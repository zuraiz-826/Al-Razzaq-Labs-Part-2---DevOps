Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, students should have:

• Basic understanding of Linux command line operations • Familiarity with log file formats and structure • Basic knowledge of Elasticsearch concepts (indices, documents, fields) • Understanding of web application architecture • Previous experience with Kibana interface navigation

Lab Environment Setup
Ready-to-Use Cloud Machines: Al Nafi provides pre-configured Linux-based cloud machines with the complete ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) already installed and running. Simply click Start Lab to access your environment - no need to build your own VM or install software.

Your lab environment includes: • Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with ELK Stack 8.x • Sample application logs pre-loaded • Kibana accessible via web browser • All necessary tools and dependencies installed

Task 1: Query Logs in Kibana Based on Specific Filters
Subtask 1.1: Access Kibana and Explore Sample Data
Open your web browser and navigate to Kibana:

http://localhost:5601
Log in to Kibana using the default credentials:

Username: elastic
Password: changeme
Navigate to Discover by clicking on the hamburger menu (☰) and selecting "Discover"

Verify the index pattern is set to logstash-* or logs-* in the dropdown at the top left

Examine the sample data by scrolling through the log entries to understand the structure:

Timestamp fields
Log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG)
Source applications
Message content
Subtask 1.2: Create Basic Text Queries
Search for error messages using the search bar at the top:

level:ERROR
Refine your search to find specific error types:

level:ERROR AND message:"database connection"
Search for multiple log levels using OR operator:

level:ERROR OR level:WARN
Use wildcard searches to find patterns:

message:*timeout*
Search within a specific time range by clicking the time picker in the top right and selecting "Last 24 hours"

Subtask 1.3: Apply Advanced Filters
Add a field filter by clicking the "+" icon next to any field in the left sidebar:

Select host.name field
Choose "is" operator
Enter a specific hostname
Create a range filter for response times:

Click "Add filter" button
Select response_time field
Choose "is between" operator
Enter range: 1000 to 5000 (milliseconds)
Combine multiple filters by adding another filter:

Field: http.response.status_code
Operator: "is one of"
Values: 404, 500, 503
Save your search by clicking "Save" in the top menu:

Name: "Error Analysis Search"
Description: "Errors and warnings with slow response times"
Subtask 1.4: Use KQL (Kibana Query Language) for Complex Queries
Switch to KQL if not already enabled (toggle in search bar)

Query for failed authentication attempts:

message:"authentication failed" and source.ip:*
Find logs from specific applications:

service.name:"web-app" and log.level:ERROR
Search for patterns in user agents:

user_agent.name:"Chrome" and http.response.status_code >= 400
Create a complex query combining multiple conditions:

(log.level:ERROR or log.level:WARN) and @timestamp >= "2024-01-01" and not message:"expected error"
Task 2: Create Visualizations Based on Log Data

Add a filter for error level:

log.level:ERROR
Add another bucket for split rows:

Sub-aggregation: Terms
Field: service.name.keyword
Size: 5
Format the table:

Show totals
Enable pagination
Sort by count descending
Save as "Top Error Messages"

Subtask 2.4: Build a Geographic Distribution Map
Create a "Maps" visualization

Add a layer:

Select "Documents"
Index pattern: logstash-*
Configure the map:

Geospatial field: geoip.location
Tooltip fields: source.ip, geoip.country_name, geoip.city_name
Add filters to show only relevant traffic:

http.response.status_code >= 400

Troubleshooting Tips
Common Issues and Solutions
Issue: No data appearing in Kibana

Solution: Check if Elasticsearch is running: sudo systemctl status elasticsearch
Verify index patterns exist: Go to Stack Management → Index Patterns
Issue: Visualizations not loading

Solution: Refresh the browser cache and check the time range filter
Ensure the selected index pattern contains data for the chosen time period
Issue: Slow query performance

Solution: Add more specific filters to reduce the data set
Use shorter time ranges for complex queries
Consider using sampled data for large datasets
Issue: Filters not working as expected

Solution: Check field mapping types (text vs keyword)
Use .keyword suffix for exact matches on text fields
Verify filter syntax and operators
Best Practices for Log Analysis
Query Optimization
Use specific time ranges to improve performance
Apply filters early in your query chain
Use field existence checks: _exists_:field_name
Leverage index patterns effectively
Visualization Design
Choose appropriate chart types for your data
Use consistent color schemes across dashboards
Include meaningful titles and descriptions
Set appropriate refresh intervals
Dashboard Organization
Group related visualizations logically
Use consistent time ranges across panels
Implement proper access controls
Document dashboard purposes and usage
Conclusion
In this comprehensive lab, you have successfully:

• Mastered log querying techniques in Kibana using both simple text searches and advanced KQL queries to filter and find specific log entries, error messages, and patterns across your application infrastructure

• Created meaningful visualizations from raw log data, including distribution charts, timelines, tables, and geographic maps that transform complex log information into easily understandable visual insights

• Built comprehensive dashboards that provide real-time monitoring capabilities for application logs, complete with interactive filters, controls, and automated refresh functionality

• Implemented monitoring best practices including saved searches, alerts, and application-specific dashboards that enable proactive identification and resolution of issues

These skills are essential for modern DevOps and system administration roles, particularly in enterprise environments where log analysis is critical for maintaining application performance, security, and reliability. The ability to quickly identify patterns, troubleshoot issues, and create actionable insights from log data directly supports business continuity and operational excellence.

Your newly acquired Kibana expertise will enable you to effectively monitor distributed applications, identify performance bottlenecks, track security incidents, and provide data-driven insights to development and operations teams. This knowledge is particularly valuable for Red Hat OpenShift environments where centralized logging and monitoring are crucial for managing containerized applications at scale.
